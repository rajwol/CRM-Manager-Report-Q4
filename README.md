# Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

Managers of MavenTech recently implemented a new CRM software that collects their B2B sales pipeline data to track performance. While the system efficiently collects vast amounts of data, sales managers needed an efficient way to analyze team performance without sifting through the raw numbers. This is where my expertise comes in.

This project focuses on developing a Power BI dashboard intended for sales managers of MavenTech to analyze their performance for the latest 2024 fiscal quarter compared to the prior quarter as well as company-wide averages. I was able to create DAX calculations in Power BI to generate key metrics and insights. SQL queries were used to validate the calculations and ensure data accuracy. The dashboard also allows managers to assess the performance of their specific sales agents, enabling them to identify areas for improvement, agents who may need additional support, and can serve as a discussion guideline during individual performance evaluation periods.

## This dashboard looks to answer the following questions for MavenTech Managers:
1. How did my team perform collectively and individually during the last fiscal quarter?
2. How do these metrics compare to the prior quarter and the company average?
3. Who are my top performers, and which agents may need additional support?
4. Which products are key drivers of revenue, and which have the potential for growth?

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Sales:** **$311K** (below company average of $467K)
- **New Opportunities:** **147** (down from 287 last quarter)
- **Avg. Weeks to Close:** **6.69 weeks** (slightly above team average of 6.64 weeks)
- **Product Performance:** **GTX Pro leads with $120K in total sales, followed by GTX Plus Pro at $87K**
- **% of Sales Discounted:** High across all agents (above 40% on average)

### Recommendations:
- **Focus on improving new opportunity generation** – A sharp drop in new opportunities is alarming. Strategies like better lead qualification and more proactive outreach are needed. This is evident for someone like Garret Kinder, who demonstrates efficiency with an impressive average close time (5.4 weeks) and deal value ($3.3K), however his underwhelming sales volume (16 sales) results in a low revenue contribution ($52,812), suggesting untapped potential in deal acquisition.  
- **Reduce discounting strategies** – With some sales reps discounting over 50% of sales, profitability is likely taking a hit. Adjust pricing strategy or offer value-driven incentives instead. This benefits sales agents including Violet Mclelland, who has strong numbers in her opportunities (35 sales) and conversion rate (~61%) yet brought in a team low $25K in total revenue due to averaging a deal value of only $702.
- **Leverage GTX Pro’s strong performance** – As the best-selling product, invest in targeted campaigns and deeper client engagement to increase conversions and total sales.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Sales:** **$430K** (down from $491K last quarter)
- **Avg. Sales Value:** **$2,403** (below last quarter’s $2,819)
- **New Opportunities:** **179** (compared to 394 last quarter)
- **Product Performance:** **MG Advanced is a clear top performer at $174K in sales**
- **Potential Revenue:** 334 engaged opportunities totaling over **$1 million** in potential revenue

### Recommendations:
- **Prioritize protracted deals** – With over **$1M in potential revenue**, the team is positioned for strong growth. However, with ongoing deals dating back to the prior year, efforts need to be made to close ongoing deals and mark protracted deals as lost in order to maximize overall sales and clean up the CRM software from bottleneck sales.
- **Optimize pricing strategy for MG Advanced** – It accounts for **40%+ of total revenue**, so bundling or upselling opportunities should be explored.  
- **Improve consistency in discounting** – While some agents are keeping discounts low (9.95%), others are **discounting over 84%**, which is unsustainable. Implement standard discounting policies.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Sales:** **$317K** (Above last quarter’s $285K)
- **Avg. Sales Value:** **$1,488** (lower than the company's average of $2,351)
- **Avg. Weeks to Close:** **7 weeks** (longer than the team’s average of 6.64 weeks)
- **Product Performance:** **GTX Plus Pro and MG Advanced dominate sales**
- **Agent Performance:** Some agents show conversion rates above 65%, others struggle below 56%

### Recommendations:
- **Quality & Quantity** – The team’s average deal size ($1.5K average) and total new opportunities (157) is well below the company's average of $2.4K and 194 opportunities, indicating a need for targeting opportunities of greater quantity and higher-value.
- **Reduce sales cycle time** – The **near 7-week close time** is among the highest. Process automation or better lead qualification can improve efficiency.  
- **Capitalize on strong product performers** – GTX Plus Pro and MG Advanced are **high-value sellers**, and the team should **prioritize high-intent prospects for these products**.  
- **Refine sales coaching** – Some agents are converting at **70.8%**, while others are below 56%. Best practices from top performers should be replicated across the team.

## 4. Melvin Marxen – Leveraging Top Performers for Scale
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b9285906-e4b8-4c5b-b2a5-f7b98e0f380c)

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Sales:** **$671K** (significantly above the company's $467K average)
- **Avg. Sales Value:** **$2,760**
- **New Opportunities:** **244** (compared to 629 last quarter)
- **Product Performance:** **GTX Pro dominates with $356K in sales**
- **Agent Contribution:** Darcel Schlecht alone generated **$357K in revenue** (more than 50% of the team’s total)

### Recommendations:
- **Scale the best-performing agent’s strategies** – Darcel Schlecht contributes over 50% of the team's revenue ($357K) with strong deal sizes ($3.8K average). Leveraging her strategies and insights through training and mentorship could potentially uplift overall team performance. 
- **Enhance new opportunity creation** – Though sales are strong, the **drop in opportunities (from 629 to 244)** could signal **future declines if the pipeline is not refilled**.  
- **Continue capitalizing on GTX Pro** – It’s the team’s highest performer, but with a **55.2% conversion rate**, there’s room for improvement through lead targeting.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Sales:** **$514K** (Above the company's $467K average)
- **Avg. Sales Value:** **$2,935** (Greater value than the company's $2.3K average)
- **New Opportunities:** **189** (compared to 413 last quarter)
- **Product Performance:** **GTX Pro dominates with $224K in generated revenue**

### Recommendations:
- **Balanced Performance** - With over half of the sales team generating over $100K in revenue, leverage the high-performing agents to boost efficiency for someone such as Daneille Hammack, who shows a slight struggle with a team low number of sales (27) and generated revenue ($78K).
- **High Performing Product** - The GTX Pro accounts for more than half of the total revenue generated for the evaluated quarter and a high conversion rate of 72%, indicating a winning product. Upselling and cross-selling opportunities should be explored for GTX pro customers to keep performance high while leveraging other products that do not perform as well.
- **Address High Discount Rates** - With a majority of the team having 40% if their sales discounted, implementing discounting practices should be standardized to protect profit margins.

### Key Metrics:
- **Total Sales:** **$560K** (Above the company average and improved from the prior quarter)
- **Avg. Sales Value:** **$2,248** (Hovering below the companys $2.3K average)
- **New Opportunities:** **249** (Above the company's 194 average)
- **Engaged Opportunities:** **414** (Company high)

### Recommendations:
- **Capitalize on bottleneck sales** - With a company high of 414 opportunites stuck in the negotiation phase, priotity should be placed on making the most of ongoing deals to maximize team revenue and performance. Strong emphasis should be placed on deals dating back to the prior year.
- **Address High Discounting** - While revenue is on an uptrend, heavy discounting across agents may be reducing profitability, as indicated by the average sales value ($2,248). By introducing value-based sales training and structured discounting policies, the team can ensure profitability and help agents close deals at better prices.

## General Recommendations 

- **Optimize CRM Data Utilization:** Leverage CRM insights to identify leads with high revenue potential and monitor team performance metrics more granularly.
  
- **Sales Training:** Focus on margin improvement, pricing discipline, and advanced negotiation techniques for agents with high discount rates.

- **Pipeline Cleanup:** All managers, especially Celia and Summer should prioritize closing up on sales that date back to the prior year in order to prioritize newer deals.
  
- **Targeted Product Strategy:** Push high-value products like GTX Pro and MG Advanced while analyzing why others (e.g., MG Special, GTK 500) perform poorly. Targeted promotion campaigns may encourage certain accounts to try the underperforming hardware.
  
- **Cross-Manager Collaboration:** Managers with overlapping challenges (e.g., high discounting, low sale value) can benefit from shared training and mentorship sessions from other sales agents.
