# Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview

Managers of MavenTech recently implemented a new CRM software that collects their B2B sales pipeline data to track performance. While the system efficeintly collects vast amounts of data, sales managers needed an efficient way to analyze team performance without sifting through the raw numbers. This is where my expertise comes in.

This project focuses on developing a Power BI dashboard intented for sales managers of MavenTech to analyze their performance for the latest 2024 fiscal quarter compared to the prior quarter as well as company-wide averages. I was able to create DAX calculations in Power BI to generate key metrics and insights. SQL queries were used to validate the calculations and ensure data accuracy. The dashboard also allows managers to assess the performance of their specific sales agents, enabling them to identify areas for improvement, agents who may need additional support, and can serve as a discussion guideline during individual performance evaluation periods.

## This dashboard looks to answer the following questions for MavenTech Managers:
1. How did my team perform collectively and individually during the last fiscal quarter?
2. How do these metrics compare to the prior quarter and the company average?
3. Who are my top performers, and which agents may need additional support?
4. Which products are key drivers of revenue, and which have the potential for growth?

## Manager Analysis

**Cara Locsh** 
- Garret Kinder demonstrates efficiency with an impressive close time of 5.4 weeks and $3.3K average deal size, but his underwhelming sales volume (16 sales) results in a low revenue contribution ($52,812), suggesting untapped potential in deal acquisition. Increasing his opportunity pipeline and encouraging targeted lead engagement should be prioritized
- Violet Mclelland, while excelling with a high conversion rate (61.4%) and total sales (35), lags in total revenue as a result of a significantly low deal value ($702 average). Focus should be put on upselling and cross-selling high-value products to address this gap.

**Celia Rouche**
- With over $1M in potential revenue, the team is positioned for strong growth. However, efforts need to be made to close ongoing deals and mark protracted deals as lost in order to maximize overall sales and clean up the CRM software from bottleneck sales.
- Rosalina’s high discount rate (84.56%) may be negatively impacting revenue margins. Training in value-based selling and negotiation strategies may mitigate this concern. 

**Dustin Brikkmann**
- The team’s deal size ($1.5K average) and total new opportunities (157) is well below the all-teams average of $2.4K and 194 opportunities, indicating a need for targeting opportunities of greater quantity and higher-value.

**Melvin Marxen**
- Darcel Schlecht contributes over 50% of the team's revenue ($357K) with strong deal sizes ($3.8K average). Leveraging her strategies and insights through training and mentorship could potentially uplift overall team performance.

**Rocco Neubert**
- While total sales ($512K) and sales value (2.9K average) indicate a strong quarter, discount rates remain high throughout all sales agents. This is prominent with someone like Cassey, who stands out with $110K in total sales but exhibits a high discount percentage (61%), suggesting her and the team can benefit from improved negotiation skills.

**Summer Sewald**
- The team’s $993K potential revenue and a company high 414 engaged opportunities suggests bottlenecks in the negotiation phase. Cleaning up the pipeline by closing on ongoing opportunities should be prioritized with emphasis on deals dating back to the prior year.
- Having the most opportunities within the company, Summer should focus on identifying premium leads to maximize revenue potential and drive overall performance.

## General Recommendations 

- **Optimize CRM Data Utilization:** Leverage CRM insights to identify leads with high revenue potential and monitor team performance metrics more granularly.
  
- **Sales Training:** Focus on margin improvement, pricing discipline, and advanced negotiation techniques for agents with high discount rates.

- **Pipeline Cleanup:** All managers, especially Celia and Summer should prioritize closing up on sales that date back to the prior year in order to prioritize newer deals.
  
- **Targeted Product Strategy:** Push high-value products like GTX Pro and MG Advanced while analyzing why others (e.g., MG Special, GTK 500) perform poorly. Targeted promotion campaigns may encourage certain accounts to try the underperforming hardware.
  
- **Cross-Manager Collaboration:** Managers with overlapping challenges (e.g., high discounting) can benefit from shared training and mentorship sessions from other sales agents.
